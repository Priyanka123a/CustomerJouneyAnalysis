**Requirements**
Install the following Python libraries before running the script:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip
**Steps**
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or directly in the terminal).
The script generates the following outputs:
Elbow plot to determine the number of clusters.
Cluster visualizations using PCA and t-SNE.
Console output for the silhouette score.
A CSV file (customer_journey_clusters.csv) containing the dataset with cluster labels.
Notes
Adjust the optimal_k value in the script to experiment with different cluster counts.
Replace the simulated dataset with real-world data for practical applications.
Ensure all features in real-world data are appropriately preprocessed (e.g., handling missing values).
